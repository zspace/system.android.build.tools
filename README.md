# system.android.build.tools

Cross compilers gcc 4.8/4.9 toolchains for arm and arm64 (aka aarch64) for AmLogic meson p230 android-o (7) build.

The toolchains already disappeared from amlogic open source website and scattered all over Internet

This is just a preservation effort in case they are gone for good.
